var socket = io.connect('10.0.0.24:2520', {secure: false}); //This line declares a socket.io object to var "socket" and connects to the server
//The "secure: false" tells if the connection will be encrypted or not. Since we will not encrypt our connections, this is false.

//Socket.io has several functions. The .on function refers to what will happen when the client receive a call called 'connect' from the server
//View it as calling a function remotley. The server tells the client it wants to call this function with no arguments.
socket.on('connect',function() { //When you connect to the server (and it works) call this function
    console.log('Client has connected to the server!'); //The client prints this message
}); //The 'connect' function/identifier is the standard procedure. To make something more we have to make it ourselves

socket.on('clientConnected',function(id, ip) { //This is our selfmade functions. Here we can have the server return arguments (data) that we need
    console.log('Client recevied ID: ' + id); //In this case the server will tell us what our local ID is (auto assigned)
    console.log("Client IP: " + ip);//And it will tell us what our IP-address

});


//In this function (which is essentially built up the same as a void function in Arduino) we want to send something to the server
//For this we use the other important Socket.io function, .emit(arg). Here we are telling our socket object so call the "changeLEDState" function
//on the server with the "state" argument. By calling the function on the server we mean that we send data to the server that tells it to do something

function changeDriveState(state) {

    socket.emit('changeDriveState', state); //Same logic as earlier, this calls the change of motor direction
    console.log("changeDriveState called");

}

function changeTurnState(state) {

    socket.emit('changeTurnState', state);
    console.log("changeTurnState called");

}
